# JAVA-TP
Exercise 1:
Write a Java program that allows the user to input student grades into an array named notes. The program should:

Sort and display the list of grades.
Display the average grade.
Display the highest and lowest grades.
Display how many students received a specific grade entered by the user. Hint: Use Arrays.sort() to sort the grades.

Exercise 2:
Write a Java program that conjugates first-group verbs (ending in "er") in the present tense, while handling some specific cases. The program should:

Conjugate regular verbs ending in "er", excluding "aller" (which is irregular).
Handle verbs ending in "yer" by using "ie" for singular forms and "ient" for plural.
Conjugate verbs ending in "ger" by adding "eons" for the first-person plural ("nous").
Conjugate verbs ending in "cer" by adding "Ã§ons" for the first-person plural ("nous").
If the verb belongs to the third group or doesn't follow these rules, the program should display a message indicating that the verb belongs to another group.
